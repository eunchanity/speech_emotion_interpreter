# Speech Emotion Interpreter

A deployed app using Streamlit and Heroku that processes input audio and returns speech emotion and speaker gender.

The app was created as part of my <a href="https://github.com/eunchanity/davids_repo/tree/master/projects/project5_speech_emotion" target="_blank">project</a> that used a convoluted neural network model for classification of speech emotion and gender.

The deployed app can be found here: <a href="https://breast-cancer-tumor-classifer.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">https://breast-cancer-tumor-classifer.herokuapp.com/</a>
